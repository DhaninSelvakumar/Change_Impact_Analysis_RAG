# Change_Impact_Analysis_RAG
ðŸ“„ Change Impact Analysis using RAG + LLaMA

This project is designed to analyze changes between two versions of documents and assess their potential impact. It combines document comparison, semantic search, and AI-powered reasoning to provide a structured change impact analysis.

The workflow is:

Document Comparison â€“ Detects differences between old and new versions, including added, deleted, and modified files.

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) â€“ Uses semantic search with embeddings (via SentenceTransformers + FAISS) to find related content that may be affected by the changes.

Impact Analysis with LLaMA/Mistral â€“ Generates an AI-driven explanation of the changes, highlighting possible risks, dependencies, and recommendations.

Visualization & Reporting â€“ Results are displayed in a Streamlit dashboard, including change summaries, detailed diffs, and exportable reports (JSON/Markdown).
